# Chess 2019 Lichess.org DataSet exploration

This analysis explores a dataset of 20000 Chess Matches from user of the top 200 teams of Liches.org between players between 784 and 2723 rating system in the GLicko chess rating system.

For this analysis, I am particularly interested in finding out inisghts about match behaviours in Amateur players to see if I can use that behaviours to improve my chess rating wich is currently 984. Once I do a exploratory data analysis I would like to find out wich are the better openings for black and white in amateur players to use them in my favour in upcoming matches.

# Gestioo Data Analysis
Hi, My name is Carlos Arauz and I i am a intern at Worldtime Watch Service Center.
4 month ago Worldtime Watch Service Center installed Gestioo a software where among many things facilitates data collection where it automatically updates a Excel file with all current and past orders.
I have created a R script, so that Worldtime Watch Service Center who is the exclusive workshop for Omega, Tissot, Buloga, Longiness, Swatch and other brands in Panama does not have to manually analyze data recieved from Gestioo software in Excel every week for the weekly report.
